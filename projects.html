    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>
        At least two programming projects you have completed from other (previous) computer science courses.  
        Each project page should have its own page that contains the code for the project, a description of the project,
        and screenshots of example executions of the project.  You should make sure your code is well designed and well
        commented (feel free to polish your old work).
        At least one assignment from a class outside of computer science. Each project page should have its own page 
        that contains a PDF (or some other accessible form) of the assignment, a description of the project, 
        and a summary of how you believe the work is related to your capstone project. Again feel free to polish your old work.
